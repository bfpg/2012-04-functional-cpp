# Functional C++ TODO list.

The little stuff goes here, to remind me to get around to it one day. The big
stuff is still spinning around my head.

## Documentation

- rationale: immutability and sharing.
- concepts: immutable types and value types, remove `immutable.hpp`.
- terminology: strict, lazy, boxed, unboxed.
- sum types: implicit and explicit tags.

## Exception safety

- `noexcept` specifications, `std::move_if_noexcept` where appropriate.
- review and document exception-safety requirements and guarantees.

## Namespace

- move everything to namespace fp.
