# Functional C++ TODO list.

The little stuff goes here, to remind me to get around to it one day. The big
stuff is still spinning around my head.

## Documentation

- rationale: immutability and sharing.
- concepts: immutable types and value types (then remove immutable.hpp).
- taxonomy: strict, lazy, boxed, unboxed.

## Exception safety

- noexcept specifications, std::move_if_noexcept where appropriate.
- review and document except safety requirements and guarantees.

## Namespace

- move everything to namespace fp.
