# Functional C++

A library for functional programming in C++, including support for immutable
algebraic data types.

## Past

This library was initially developed for a [talk][] given at the [Brisbane
Functional Programming Group][BFPG]. Slides for the talk are available in the
doc directory.

## Present

For now, there's a strict sum type with basic pattern-matching support, and
some simple examples.

## Future

In time, I hope to include better support for pattern matching, lazy
evaluation, a selection of immutable data structures, useful higher-order
abstractions, and documentation.
